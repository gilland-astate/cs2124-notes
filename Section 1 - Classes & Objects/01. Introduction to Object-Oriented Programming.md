# Procedural Programming
## 1. Introduction to Procedural Programming
- **Definition**: Procedural programming, also known as structured programming, is a programming paradigm that emphasizes a logical sequence of steps or procedures to solve problems. It breaks down a program into smaller, more manageable parts.
## 2. Function-Centric Approach
- **Focus on Functions**: The central concept in procedural programming is the _function_. Programs are divided into small, manageable pieces called functions or procedures.
- **Purpose of Functions**: Functions are designed to perform specific tasks, making the code easier to manage and understand.
- **Example**: Think of a function as a recipe; it takes input (ingredients), processes it, and provides output (a finished dish).
## 3. Global Data Handling
- **Global Variables**: Procedural programs often use global or non-protected data that can be accessed and modified by multiple functions within the program.
- **Potential Issues**: This approach can lead to problems with data consistency and integrity because any function can alter the global data, making debugging more complex.
## 4. Sequential Execution
- **Linear Flow**: Procedural programming follows a sequential execution model, meaning the program executes one statement after another in a linear order.
- **Control Structures**: The flow can be controlled using conditional statements (e.g., `if`, `else`) and loops (e.g., `for`, `while`).
- **Example**: The program starts at the top, checks conditions, executes loops, and proceeds step-by-step until it reaches the end.
## 5. Reusability and Modularity
- **Modular Design**: Functions allow for code to be reused across different parts of the program. This modularity helps in breaking down complex tasks into simpler ones.
- **Challenges in Large Codebases**: As the program grows, maintaining functions can become challenging. Functions might lack context about the data they manipulate, leading to potential issues in larger codebases.
## 6. Basic Unit of Modularity: The Function
- **Function as a Building Block**: In procedural programming, the function is the basic unit of modularity. It encapsulates specific tasks, making it easier to manage and reuse code.
- **Advantages**: Functions enhance readability and maintainability by allowing developers to focus on individual components of the program.
- **Example**: A function that calculates the average of a list of numbers can be used multiple times within the program without rewriting the logic.
## 7. Conclusion
- **Summary**: Procedural programming is a fundamental approach that emphasizes a function-centric, sequentially executed design. While it offers modularity and reusability, it also presents challenges in managing global data and maintaining large codebases.
- **Applications**: This paradigm is widely used in various programming languages such as C, Pascal, and Python (in its procedural style), and remains a foundational concept in software development.

# Object-Oriented Programming
## 1. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
- **Definition**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of "objects," which are instances of classes. It provides a way to structure programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.
## 2. Class-Centric Design
- **Focus on Classes**: The core element in OOP is the _class_, which serves as a blueprint for creating objects. A class defines the properties (data) and methods (behaviors) that its objects will have.
- **Objects as Instances**: Objects are specific instances of a class, embodying the data and behaviors defined by the class.
- **Example**: Consider a class `Car` with attributes like `color`, `model`, and methods like `drive()` and `brake()`. Each specific car, like a red Toyota, would be an object created from this class.
## 3. Encapsulation
- **Data Hiding**: Encapsulation is a key principle in OOP that ensures an object's internal state is hidden from the outside world. This is achieved by making the internal data private and exposing only what is necessary through public methods, known as interfaces.
- **Control Access**: Encapsulation protects the integrity of the data by restricting direct access and modification, thereby reducing the risk of unintended interference.
- **Example**: A `BankAccount` class might encapsulate the account balance, allowing it to be accessed or modified only through specific methods like `deposit()` or `withdraw()`.
## 4. Inheritance and Polymorphism
- **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reusability. The class that inherits is called the _subclass_, and the class being inherited from is the _superclass_.
- **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows methods to be used interchangeably, depending on the object type. It enables method overriding, where a subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
- **Example**: A `Vehicle` class might have a method `move()`. Both `Car` and `Bicycle` classes could inherit from `Vehicle`, but each might override `move()` to implement it differently.
## 5. Modularity and Maintainability
- **Enhanced Modularity**: OOP enhances modularity by grouping related data and behaviors together in classes. This logical organization makes it easier to understand, develop, and debug programs.
- **Maintainability**: Large codebases benefit from OOP's structure, as it allows developers to make changes or extend functionalities without affecting other parts of the program.
- **Example**: If you need to add a new feature to the `Car` class, like `startEngine()`, you can do so without disrupting the `Bicycle` class.
## 6. Basic Unit of Modularity: The Class
- **Class as a Building Block**: In OOP, the class is the basic unit of modularity. Each class represents a distinct concept or entity within the program, encapsulating its own data and methods.
- **Advantages**: Classes provide a clear structure, making the codebase more organized and easier to maintain. They allow for the abstraction of complex systems into simpler, manageable units.
- **Example**: A `Library` system might have classes like `Book`, `Member`, and `Librarian`, each encapsulating specific data and behaviors relevant to that entity.
## 7. Conclusion
- **Summary**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful paradigm that focuses on creating modular, maintainable, and reusable code by organizing programs around classes and objects. Its core principles—encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism—promote code efficiency and flexibility.
- **Applications**: OOP is widely used in many programming languages like Java, C++, Python (in its OOP style), and C#. It is particularly effective in managing complex software systems, making it a foundational concept in modern software development.

# Encapsulation
## 1. Introduction to Encapsulation
- **Definition**: Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that refers to bundling related data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that manipulate that data into a single unit known as an object. This concept not only organizes code but also protects it from unintended interference.
## 2. Unified Structure
- **Bundling of Data and Methods**: Encapsulation allows us to combine data and methods that operate on that data into a single entity, typically a class. This creates a unified structure where related attributes and behaviors are logically grouped.
- **Object Representation**: In OOP, an object is an instance of a class where this bundling occurs, providing a clear structure and organization.
- **Example**: A class `Square` might include an attribute `side` and methods `getSide()` and `setSide()` to access and modify this attribute. All of these are encapsulated within the `Square` class.
## 3. Data Hiding
- **Protection of Internal State**: Encapsulation ensures that an object's internal representation is hidden from the outside world. This means external code cannot directly access or modify the internal data of an object.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: By hiding internal data, encapsulation enforces the principle of least privilege, where only necessary parts of the program can interact with an object's data. This reduces the risk of accidental or malicious changes to the internal state.
- **Example**: In the `Square` class, the `side` attribute is marked as `private`, meaning it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. This protects the data from unintended modifications.
## 4. Controlled Access
- **Accessors and Mutators**: Encapsulation promotes controlled access to an object's data through public methods. These methods are often referred to as accessors (getters) and mutators (setters).
- **Layer of Protection**: By using these public methods, the class controls how its data is accessed or modified, adding a layer of protection. This reduces the likelihood of bugs by preventing direct and uncontrolled access to the internal data.
- **Example**: In the `Square` class, `getSide()` is an accessor that allows external code to read the value of `side`, and `setSide(int newSide)` is a mutator that allows controlled modification of `side`.
## 5. Ease of Maintenance
- **Modularity in Design**: Encapsulation enhances modularity by allowing each object to manage its own state and behavior. This modular approach simplifies the maintenance of large and complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable components.
- **Isolation of Changes**: When changes are needed, they can be made within the class without affecting other parts of the program, making the codebase easier to manage and maintain.
- **Example**: If you need to change how the `Square` calculates its side length, you only need to modify the `Square` class, leaving the rest of the program unaffected.
## 6. Encapsulation Example
```c++
class Square { 
	public: 
		int getSide() const { return side; } 
		void setSide(int newSide) { side = newSide; } 
	private: 
		int side; 
};
```
#### 1. **Unified Structure**
- **Bundling in Action**: In the `Square` class, the data attribute `side` is encapsulated with the methods `getSide()` and `setSide()` that operate on it, creating a unified structure.
#### 2. **Data Hiding**
- **Private Data**: The `private` keyword in the `Square` class ensures that `side` is hidden from outside access. Only the public methods `getSide()` and `setSide()` can interact with this attribute, protecting the data from unintended external changes.
#### 3. **Controlled Access**
- **Public Methods**: The `Square` class provides controlled access to its `side` attribute through the public methods `getSide()` and `setSide()`. This ensures that any interaction with `side` is managed and predictable, reducing the risk of errors.
#### 4. **Ease of Maintenance**
- **Isolated Modifications**: If you need to modify the behavior related to the `side` attribute, you only need to update the code within the `Square` class. This encapsulation makes it easier to maintain and update the code without impacting other parts of the system.

# Inheritance
## 1. Introduction to Inheritance
- **Definition**: Inheritance is a key concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a new class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy among classes.
## 2. Factoring out Common Data/Behavior

- **Reduction of Duplication**: Inheritance enables the extraction of common attributes and methods shared across multiple classes into a single, common superclass. This reduces code duplication by centralizing common functionality.
- **Shared Code Base**: By factoring out common elements, inheritance allows multiple subclasses to share the same code, improving maintainability and consistency across the application.
- **Example**: If multiple shape classes (e.g., `Square`, `Circle`) share the same attributes like `x` and `y` coordinates, these can be factored into a common `Shape` class.
## 3. Standardizing a Common Interface
- **Consistent Interaction**: Inheritance provides a way to define a common interface that all subclasses must adhere to, ensuring consistent behavior and interaction between objects of different types.
- **Unified Design**: This standardization simplifies the design of the system by ensuring that all subclasses share the same methods and attributes, making it easier to interact with them in a uniform way.
- **Example**: The `Shape` class can standardize the interface for setting and getting coordinates, ensuring that all shapes, regardless of their specific type, have these capabilities.
## 4. Facilitate Extensibility
- **Ease of Adding New Classes**: Inheritance makes it easy to add new classes that build on the functionality of existing ones. New subclasses can inherit from the common superclass and extend or override its functionality without altering the existing code base.
- **Supporting Application Growth**: This extensibility allows the application to grow and evolve over time, supporting new requirements and features while preserving the integrity of the original structure.
- **Example**: You can add new shapes like `Triangle` or `Rectangle` by inheriting from the `Shape` class, leveraging the existing coordinate-handling methods without modifying the `Shape` class.
## 5. Inheritance Example
```c++
class Shape { 
	public: 
		std::pair<int,int> getCoordinates() const { 
			return std::pair<int,int>(x,y); 
		} 
		void setCoordinates(int newX, int newY) { 
			x = newX; 
			y = newY; 
		} 
	private: 
		int x = 0; 
		int y = 0; 
}; 

class Square : public Shape { 
	public: 
		int getSide() const { return side; } 
		void setSide(int newSide) { side = newSide; } 
	private: 
	int side = 1; 
};
```
#### 1. **Factoring out Common Data/Behavior**
- In this example, the `Shape` class contains attributes (`x` and `y` coordinates) and methods (`getCoordinates()`, `setCoordinates()`) that are common to all shapes. These have been factored out of specific shape classes like `Square` and centralized in the `Shape` class.
#### 2. **Standardizing a Common Interface**
- The `Shape` class establishes a common interface that all shapes will adhere to, specifically that all shapes will have `x` and `y` coordinates that can be accessed and modified through the `getCoordinates()` and `setCoordinates()` methods. This ensures consistent interaction with all shape objects.
#### 3. **Facilitate Extensibility**
- With the `Shape` class in place, new shape classes like `Square` can be easily added by inheriting from `Shape`. The `Square` class extends `Shape` by adding a `side` attribute and its corresponding methods, without altering the original `Shape` class. This facilitates the addition of more shapes in the future while maintaining a clean and organized codebase.

# OOP Terminology
## 1. Class
- **Definition**: A _class_ is a fundamental concept in OOP that encapsulates data and functions that are related to a specific entity or concept. It serves as a blueprint for creating objects.
- **Blueprint Analogy**: Just as a blueprint outlines the design of a building without being the building itself, a class defines the structure and behavior of objects but does not create them until instantiated.
- **Example**: In C++, a `class` might define a `Car` with attributes like `color` and `model`, and methods like `drive()` and `brake()`.
- **Interchangeability with Struct**: In some programming contexts, `class` and `struct` can be used somewhat interchangeably, especially in languages like C++ where both can encapsulate data and functions. However, `struct` typically defaults to public members, whereas `class` defaults to private members.
## 2. Object
- **Definition**: An _object_ is an instance of a class. It represents a tangible entity in the program that is created based on the class blueprint.
- **Real Thing Analogy**: If a class is the blueprint, then an object is the actual building constructed from that blueprint. The object embodies the specific attributes and behaviors defined by the class.
- **Example**: An instance of the `Car` class might be a specific car like a red Toyota. This `Car` object would have the color red and the model set to Toyota, as defined by its class.
## 3. Attributes
- **Definition**: _Attributes_ refer to the member data within a class. These are the characteristics or properties that define the state of an object.
- **Member Data**: Attributes are essentially variables that are encapsulated within the class. They hold the values that describe an object's state.
- **Example**: In the `Car` class, attributes might include `color`, `model`, and `year`. Each `Car` object would have specific values for these attributes.
## 3. Methods
- **Definition**: _Methods_ are the functions or procedures defined within a class that operate on the class's attributes. They represent the behaviors or actions that an object can perform.
- **Member Functions**: Methods are encapsulated within the class and are used to manipulate the attributes or to perform operations relevant to the object.
- **Example**: In the `Car` class, methods might include `drive()`, `brake()`, and `turn()`. These methods define what actions the `Car` object can perform.
